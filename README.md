RightScale and Windows Automation Powershell dump
=====

Not that it's all that difficult to figure out, but it's always helpful when someone who's already figured something out shares it so you don't have to go reinvent the wheel.  While I won't promise that these will be the most elegant, well written or even legible scripts in the world, my goal in organizing this is to provide a place for RightScalers who work in Windows to come and get examples and get some help in managing their servers automatically in the cloud.  

There are a few big ones that come to mind as far as important things to figure out, so you'll see a breakdown of a few different topics and lines of development in this repository;

  * RightScale API calls and how-to's using PowerShell
  * Idempotent strategies and examples
  * Simple install scripts and pointers to where they exist in RightScale
  * Other random learnings, tips and tricks that we've picked up along the way
  
Let us know if there's something specific you're looking for, if the code is helpful or even if you just want to let us know to keep it up!  Thanks for visiting and best of luck in your PowerShell efforts!

Best,

RightScale Windows Professional Services Team
